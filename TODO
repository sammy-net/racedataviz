Rough TODO list:

General
-------

 * Establish the idea of a single course and runs attached to that course.

 * Figure out start/finish as a way to determine the times for each
   run.  Maybe taking the actual run times as input would allow
   fitting the start/finish positions based on what events plausibly
   would fit in the run time?

 * Figure out a way to determine "distance along course" taking into
   account that some runs will use more distance than others.

3D
--

 * Figure out how to bring up panda3d again at all

 * Draw line from start->finish

 * Enhance line with width from accelerations

 * Draw dashboard (2d text on main window?) and update as time goes by

 * Figure out camera controls which allow time slider

 * Load multiple logs and find a way to superimpose (transparency and
   a toggle between active?).  Time should scrub together.

 * Get background from USDA
