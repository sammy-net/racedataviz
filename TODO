Rough TODO list:

tplot
-----

 * Make the UI sane for one log, thinking that multiple will be a thing in the future.
 * Load multiple logs and find some way to normalize the start and scroll along each other.

3D
--

 * Figure out how to bring up panda3d again at all
 * Instance proj for UTM conversions
 * Draw line from start->finish
 * Enhance line with width from accelerations
 * Draw dashboard (2d text on main window?) and update as time goes by
 * Figure out camera controls which allow time slider
 * Load multiple logs and find a way to superimpose (transparency and a toggle between active?).  Time should scrub together.
 * Get background from USDA
